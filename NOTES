graphics pipelines:
	-> input assembler (fixed-function)
		* assembles vertexes.
	-> vertex shader
		* a program invoked for every vertex.
	-> tessellation
		* creates primitives from vertexes.
	-> geometry shader
		* a program invoked for every primitive.
	-> rasterization (fixed-function)
		* creates fragments from discretizing primitives.
	-> fragment shader
		* a program invoked for every fragment.
	-> color blending (fixed-function)
		* applies mixing operations for pixels overlapped with fragments.

* shaders run under the non-fixed-function stages.

DEFINITIONS

	"fixed-function" - a predefined function that you can pass arguments to.
	anything that isn't a fixed-function can be programmed by the user.
